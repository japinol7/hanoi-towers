## Rules and user guide

The objective of this mathematical game puzzle is to move the entire disc stack to the last rod, <br> 
complying with the following rules: <br>

1. Only move one disc at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disc from one of the stacks  <br>
   and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disc may be placed on top of a disc that is smaller than it.

The minimal number of moves required to solve this puzzle is 2<sup>n</sup> âˆ’ 1,  <br>
where n is the number of discs.

Enjoy the game     ; )

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit.
	  -a, --auto            Auto mode. It does not stop between games.
	                        Only when it needs a user input
	  -g, --gamestoplay GAMESTOPLAY
	                        Games to play. Must be between 0 and 5000.
	  -i, --discs DISCS
	                        Number of hanoi discs. Must be between 1 and 7.
	  -l, --multiplelogfiles
	                        A log file by app execution, instead of one unique log file.
	  -m, --stdoutlog
	                        Print logs to the console along with writing them to the log file.
	  -n, --nologdatetime
	                        Logs will not print a datetime.
      -s, --solver
	                        solver algorithm. Available solvers: iterative, recursive
	  -u, --turnmaxsecs TURNMAXSECS
	                        Turn max seconds before the player loses 5 score points.
	                        Must be between 5 and 900.
	  -d, --debug
	                        Debug actions when pressing the right key, information and traces.
	  -t, --debugtraces
	                        show debug back traces information when something goes wrong.

**Examples of usage**

    > Play infinite games with the default 5 discs:
       $ python -m hanoitowers

    > Play with 3 discs:
       $ python -m hanoitowers --discs 3

    > Play with 3 discs with the auto solver using the recursive algorithm:
       $ python -m hanoitowers --discs 3 --solver recursive

    > Play with 3 discs and multiple log files while echoing logging to the console. No datetime:
       $ python -m hanoitowers --discs 3 --stdoutlog --multiplelogfiles --nologdatetime

    > Play with 7 discs and multiple log files while echoing logging to the console:
       $ python -m hanoitowers --discs 7 --stdoutlog --multiplelogfiles
